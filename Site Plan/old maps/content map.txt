  > Content: Can a 200-year-old prophecy, with its fate-altering implications, and a non-believer save two worlds from destruction?

Linsora Anselm is a Khizaran archaeologist. She “hears” voices from the past, making her perfect for the job. Still, she’s stuck in prison after sticking up for her principles—that is, until a mysterious individual pays the guards to help her escape. How will she react when she discovers her champion is the devil incarnate?

When Permac breaks Linsora out of prison, he can’t understand why. He’s drawn to her… but she threatened to kill him more than once because she doesn’t trust his ability to sense and influence emotions. She believes he and his race are evil, and she could be right. 

Forced together, they journey through the cosmos in search of historical facts they (and the rest of the galaxy) thought were correct. They discover pockets of truth on faraway planets and a 200-year-old prophecy that seems to intertwine Linsora and Permacs’ destinies. 

Through a galaxy of fate, love, deception, and the unknown, Permac and Linsora must learn to trust each other to protect their worlds. Otherwise, the prophecy says war will annihilate everything in its path. 

Khizara is an exhilarating, adventure-filled space opera of mystery, love, archaeology, and the enigmatic ability to control emotions with a thought. If you’re a fan of Issac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Ray Bradbury, or Frank Herbert, you’ll be captivated by this story.

  > "The characters are deeply developed and insightfully portrayed; the world-building is strong, and the overarching theme (of allegedly attempting to garner peace in the universe) holds potential for powerful social commentary." 

Blue Ink Reviews
  > "This book hooks you from page one."  Mary's Pix
  > "It’s books like this that proves again and again how feasible it is to create new worlds, new culture, new races, and new twists to the already long-established themes about divided worlds and good vs evil...Overall, I’m giving this book 5 out of 5 stars for its well-developed characters, well-depicted plot, well-described setting, and most especially for instilling values and wisdom about cultural differences and the importance of change."

Tokorel

-Intro
 > "Will Linsora's journey to Tokorel, under the watchful eye of her enemy, be a safe one? And how will the planet of Tokorel, after two centuries of animosity, receive her?

Linsora is chosen to visit the home of her people’s enemy as an ambassador, offering to mend 200 years of hostility between them. But how will she be received by these people whom the Khizaran regard as the embodiment of evil?

Her purpose is twofold. She must try to establish peaceful relations and, at the same time, locate her lost lover, whom she fears is captured or dead.
With numerous obstacles in her path, will Linsora manage to escape Tokorel unscathed? Will she be able to reunite with Permac, the man she cherishes above all?

The prophecy, which predicts the arrival of a savior who will unite both worlds, seems to align with Linsora. However, she remains skeptical, hoping it’s not her. But could an entire planet come to see her as the one who will bring their leader’s visions to life?"

- Intro: "If you found a stone whose magic could change your life, how would you use its power?

Michelangelo did his best work in Rome. Some people believe in a magical stone he found on his journey from Florence to Rome, a stone that was said to have the power to release his inner imagination. He returned the stone to the same place he had discovered it, a place steeped in mystery and magic, before returning to Florence.

At the brink of despair, Tom Parker recalls Michelangelo's tale and stumbles upon a stone of similar legend. He yearns to harness its power to resurrect his failing business and win the love of his life. But just as he is about to deliver the speech that could turn his advertising company's fate, the stone is snatched away, and Tom's mind goes blank, forgetting the best presentation he had ever conceived. Will he recover the stone? Will he salvage his business and win the girl?

This inspirational fantasy story will leave you feeling like you can do anything. Don't miss this opportunity to read the feel-good story of 2025!"

Monsters Lap

- Title
- Image (monsters lap img)
- Intro: Three-year-old Julie has a secret she has been told NOT
to tell. If she does tell, she’s been told her mommy will be hurt terribly. 
But secrets in the head of a three-year-old are like thinking that the
sun will forever hide behind the clouds. Eventually, they both come
out. 

When Julie’s secret is told, it tears apart two families
while bringing them closer together at the same time. “The 
Monster’s Lap” is a fictitious story based on the life
misfortunes and betrayals of a young three-year-old girl and the
family that loves her. You will have an intimate look into the ups
and downs of this family and the little-known process that
goes on from discovery to the final verdict in court. Can a three-year-old girl express what has happened in her life enough to convince
the District Attorney to act and bring her justice? Or will the word of a thirty-year-old charismatic man be more believable? 

“After all, who would believe a three-year-old?”

The Monster’s Lap will show you how the world can be cruel and just at the same time. It will take you into areas we don’t want to talk about out loud, and fear will infiltrate our family life.
